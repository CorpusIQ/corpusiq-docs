## How to Use External MCP Servers

Most MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, Hermes) support multiple MCP server connections simultaneously. To add an external server alongside CorpusIQ:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "corpusiq": {
      "url": "https://mcp2.corpusiq.io/mcp",
      "transport": "streamable-http"
    },
    "firecrawl": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "firecrawl-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY": "fc-YOUR_KEY"
      }
    },
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

Check each server's documentation for specific transport type (streamable HTTP, stdio, SSE) and authentication requirements.
